        <h2>Personality</h2>
        <p>I'm definetely an introvert but I like interacting with people, especially in the context of activities I'm interested in. </p>
        <p>INTP (some relevant graphic)</p>
        <p>Big 5 results (some relevant graphic)</p>

        <p><b>Politics</b>: I'm a heterodox classical liberal: I value individual autonomy, economic freedom, and meritocracy, but I also think we should redistirbute resources in the interest of social welfare. I think free markets are important because they're the most efficent way we know of to allocate resources, but that we need a welfare state because markets don't usually allocate resources fairly. I'm fairly a-partisan, meaning that I don't always identify strongly with either political party, but I'm also not against to taking a side when it comes to objective facts. I'm strongly in favor of democracy and meritocracy in government.</p>

        <p>I'm <i>very</i> curious about how the world works and so I have a wide variety of intellectual and creative interests.</p>
