        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p class="p1">Truth is a fundamental concept that is central to many controversial issues in philosophy, such as the nature of knowledge, reality, and meaning. It is also closely related to other key concepts such as belief, representation, and justification, and is often considered to be the primary standard for evaluating these concepts. Since apprehending truth is widely considered to be the aim of inquiry not only in philosophy, but also in science, mathematics, and other fields, understanding truth itself is a prerequisite to a systematic examination of these other concepts. The aim of this chapter is to provide an analysis of truth. We will begin by providing an overview of classical theories of truth such as the correspondence, coherence and pragmatic theories. Then, we will examine the contemporary literature, beginning with Tarski and continuing through additional contributions by logicians to provide a rigorous foundation for our theory of truth. Finally, we will attempt to show the intuitive appeal of our formal analysis by synthesizing it with the classical theories.</p>
        <h3>What constitutes truth</h3>
        <h4>Introduction</h4>
        <p class="p2">Ideally this essay would begin with a concise explanation of what problem it is trying to solve. A cursory examination of the related literature, however, will show that there is little consensus as to what the philosophical problem of truth is about, an issue exacerbated by the fact that many writers who proposed theories of truth didn’t give a precise characterization of the question their theory is supposed to answer. This has created something of a mess in the literature, with philosophers objecting because of a different understanding of the question… For this reason it is important to clearly establish what questions a theory of truth should answer. I’ll begin by listing some candidates.</p>
        <p class="p2">These questions are closely related to each other, but to think they are all equivalent would be a mistake. Indeed, conflating these questions is one of the reasons that writers on truth continue to misunderstand and talk past each other. Thus, we must begin by clearly laying out the questions a theory of truth may answer, before applying this framework to different candidate theories.</p>
        <p class="p2">In his seminal 1892 paper, Frege introduced the distinction between the sense and reference of singular terms. The reference of a name is the object it designates, the way that the name “Caesar” refers to a Roman general and statesman, while the sense of a name is the meaning it expresses, like the sentence “Odysseus was set ashore at Ithaca while sound asleep”, which has a meaning even though it doesn’t to refer to anything. Frege uses the example of the morning star and the evening star. Both of these terms refer to the same object—Venus—and so they have the same reference. Their sense, however, is different, since their meaning is different. The term sense is often used interchangeably with connotation or intension, and the term reference is often used interchangeably with denotation or extension. In this essay we will prefer the terms intension and extension.</p>
        <p class="p2">Importantly for our theory of truth, this distinction can be applied to definitions. An extensional definition lists everything that falls under the term. So an extensional definition of bachelor would involve listing all the unmarried men. An intensional definition specifies the necessary and sufficient conditions for determining if a term applies to an object. The intensional definition of bachelor is “unmarried man” because it is necessary that one be both a man and unmarried to be a bachelor, and these two traits together are also sufficient for being a bachelor.</p>
        <p class="p2">Two different expressions may have the same extension. The extension of “animal with a heart” and “animal with a kidney” are equivalent in the actual world, since all animals who have hearts to pump their blood also have kidneys to cleanse their blood. We can therefore say that these expressions are extensionally equivalent even though they have different meanings. Notice that these expressions may not be equivalent in all possible worlds, however, since it is at least logically possible that animals with a different evolutionary history solved the problem of cleansing the blood without a kidney. Thus we can distinguish between expressions that are necessarily extensionally equivalent and those that are actually extensionally equivalent.</p>
        <p class="p2">Even when expressions have the same extension they may not have the same intension because they can have different meanings. The necessary and sufficient conditions for being an “animal with a heart” are different from being an “animal with a kidney”, so they have different intensions. This doesn’t entail, however, that two expressions must be the same in order to have the same intension. For example, “has a heart” is intensionally equivalent to “has a blood pumping organ”, because a heart is a blood pumping organ. Notice that intensional equivalence and necessary extensional equivalence can be established a priori by analyzing the meanings of the terms, while actual extensional equivalence cannot.</p>
